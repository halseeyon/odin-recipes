    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Don't be fooled. This isn't a <em>loaded</em> baked potato or anything. Just a plain ol' potato as the world intended.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>one potato</li>
        <li>OPTIONAL: some butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Before you start, wash the potato and <strong>poke a bunch of holes in it with a fork, at least 5 times but preferably more.</strong> I cannot emphasize this enough. <em>If you do not do this step it will likely result in your potato exploding in the microwave.</em> Seriously. Just do it.</li>
        <li>Place in the microwave (on a microwave-safe dish!) and cook for 5 minutes or however long is recommended by your microwave manufacturer.</li>
        <li>Flip the potato over and cook for another 2-3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Finish off by placing in a 425-degree oven until the skin on the outside of the potato is as crisp as you want.</li>
        <li>OPTIONAL: When finished and cool enough to eat, but still warm, cut the potato down the middle and add a slice of butter. Yum!</li>
    </ol>
