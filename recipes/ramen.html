    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This ramen noodle soup recipe is a delicious take on a Japanese classic. <em>"Tonkotsu"</em>, which literally translates to <em>"pork-bone"</em>, is often characterized by a creamy, rich broth and the inclusion of pork belly. It is certainly an upgrade from the "instant noodle"-style ramen many of us are all-too familiar with!</p>
    <p>To make this recipe, you will need patience. ...And, unfortunately, since I'm just practicing my web-dev skills, and I don't want to steal a recipe from a different website (and no, I'm not using ChatGPT to do that either, LMAO), you will really only get the closest approximation of what I think goes into making tonkotsu ramen. Sorry! :D</p>
    <p><strong>DISCLAIMER: SERIOUSLY, DO NOT MAKE THIS. IF YOU MAKE THIS YOU ARE FULLY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY FOOD POISONING OR NEGATIVE EFFECTS THAT OCCUR. I HAVE NEVER TRIED MAKING TONKOTSU RAMEN AND THIS IS NOT A REAL RECIPE.</strong> Also, I took the picture from Wikimedia Commons. Sorry.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 package noodles - You can use any, but a cut made specifically for ramen soup works best</li>
        <li>pork bones - I am not totally sure where you get these. All I know is that restaurants always talk about how long it takes to make the broth. Good luck.</li>
        <li>1 lb pork belly - Yes. Really. Just put all of it in there. Yum yum.</li>
        <li>3 oz mushrooms</li>
        <li>2 sprigs of green onion</li>
        <li>oh my gosh. why did i pick such a complicated recipe for this. why didn't I just choose like a ham sandwich or something.</li>
        <li>pinch of sesame seeds</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil the pork bones in water for 5 minutes and then let simmer for 12 hours. Add some salt. You <em>do</em> have salt, right?</li>
        <li>Remove the pork bones. You now have pork bone water. Or as it's more commonly known in the soup world, broth.</li>
        <li>Boil noodles in your newly-created pork water until they are cooked but not soggy.</li>
        <li>Move into a bowl and throw some of those mushrooms and green onions into it because it makes you feel fancy.</li>
        <li>Oh my gosh, we forgot to make the pork belly. Cut it into thin slices and cook it like bacon. Then throw that on top of your soup.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle your sesame seeds on top.</li>
        <li>Stare in horror as you realize you've just created a monstrosity of a recipe from someone who doesn't know a single thing about creating tonkotsu-style ramen.</li>
    </ol>
