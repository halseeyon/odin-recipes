    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>"Hey, Hal, why do you have a PB&J recipe on your website? Can't anyone over the age of 4 make that by heart?" Yes.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 slices of bread</li>
        <li>1 jar peanut butter (whatever kind you like, although the correct answer is crunchy)</li>
        <li>1 jar jam (of your choice, but again, I must emphasize that grape jelly is the correct option)</li>
        <li>OPTIONAL: a little bit of butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Get two slices of bread and place them side-by-side.</li>
        <li>Coat one slice evenly with peanut butter.</li>
        <li>Coat the second slice with your jelly.</li>
        <li>Stick the two slices of bread together so the peanut butter and jelly are touching.</li>
        <li>OPTIONAL: coat the bottom of a non-stick pan with butter. Toast both sides of sandwich until they are golden brown.</li>
    </ol>
